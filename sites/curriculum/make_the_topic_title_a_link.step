`<th>` stands for table header and everything between `<th>` and
`</th>` was being printed as a table header (bold). We removed it
since we removed the description and it would look funny to have the
header and the wrong thing below it.

Here's another use of `link_to` to create a link on the page. This
`link_to` creates a link using the text from the topic title and goes
to the topic#show page.
