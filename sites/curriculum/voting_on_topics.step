* Just like before, we're creating a new model named "vote"
* The only thing really different is the integer we added called `topic_id`.
  * `topic_id` is the data we need to draw the line between votes and topics.
* We didn't generate a full scaffold this time because we aren't
  going to do the full CRUD for votes; they're just going to be
  considered part of topics as-is.
